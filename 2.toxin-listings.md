# 2. Anatomy of a Toxin Listing

Toxin listings provide a consolidated block of toxin traits and features. Think of them as something like a monster stat block, where the information most relevant to someone trying to make use of the toxin is gathered and listed out. Let's start with a sample toxin to set the stage.

## 2.1. Sample Toxin

### 2.1.1. Adventurer's Bane

#### Adventurer's Bane

*Severe Thaumatotoxin (Thermotoxin); Neutral Antidote*
___
**Delivery Method**: Ingestion.

**Locality**: Stationary.

**Effects**: Severe (8d6) fire damage. 

**Save**: CON DC 16. Success: half damage.

**Onset**: Immediate.

**Duration**: Instantaneous damage. No lingering effects.
___
Adventurer's Bane is a highly toxic substance that occurs naturally in the fruits of some plants that grow in volcanic craters and areas prone to wildfires. These plants are often difficult to distinguish from non-toxic varieties, and many a hungry adventurer has died as a result. This is compounded by the fact that some cultures have cultivated such plants, whose fruit they carefully prepare to remove the toxins. Adventurer's Bane is magical in nature, capable of intense energy channeling and release, by which it incinerates its hapless host from the inside. It is activated only by stomach acid, however, making it relatively safe to handle. Ecologists assume the combustion is a means of spreading the fruit's seeds, which require intense heat to germinate. That it is not universally fatal is quite surprising, and yet the literature contains many cases of survival, owing perhaps to its quickness of action and lack of lingering effects.

## 2.2 Toxin Listing, Deconstructed

The top of the block is reserved for the name of the toxin and its super and subtypes, including its strength as both a toxin and an antidote. 

Below the first line are the other characteristics, such as delivery method, toxin locality, list of effects, relevant saving throw (including results of a successful save), the onset of the toxin, and the duration of its effects. Effects, onset, saving throw conditions and results, and duration are all outlined in more detail in [Part 3](https://github.com/HilltownStudios/toxinomicon/blob/master/3.toxonomy.md) and [Part 4].

This is followed by a flavor-only description of the toxin. Since toxins are biological in origin, it is a good idea to fit the toxin into an ecological niche of some sort, describing what organisms produce it and, if known, why. You might also describe the subjective experience of exposure. 

## 2.3 On Naming

Toxins, as substances produced by living organisms, do not occur in a vacuum. True, skilled chemists may be capable of extracting and distilling toxins for use as medicines or poisons, and thus may assign a name that bears no relation to the organisms from which they are drawn, but any number of toxins are never subjected to this treatment. My recommendation is to assign names primarily based on the provenance of the toxin, and only secondarily based on extracted and distilled purposes.
