# 1. Toxicology 101

## 1.1 What is a toxin?

Simply put, for our purposes, a toxin is a poisonous substance produced by living organisms. This conceptually makes it distinct from all manner of other hazards in the world, including synthetic poisons, which are known as toxicants. Such a distinction is perhaps not important within the framework of this guide, especially since the differences in origin have little bearing on the effects of such substances. Therefore the term "toxin" will be loosely applied herein but generally assumed to mean "poisonous substance of biological origin." More precise demarcation is wholly the purview of the user and left as an exercise thereto.

Let's try again. For a substance to be toxic, it has to have some mechanism by which to affect the body, a delivery method. Ingestion is perhaps the most commonly conceived delivery method, but there are others: injection, as through animal bites or thorns; inhalation; skin contact; etc. While the biologial origins of a toxin are mostly irrelevant to this guide, the delivery methods available are very much relevant. A toxin that can only have an effect when ingested poses a much lower danger to someone whose skin is exposed, in which case washing the affected area may be all that's required to remove the threat. Similarly, toxins that must enter the bloodstream directly by injection (e.g., snake venom) or through some other means of bypassing the skin and mucous membranes may pose little or no risk through ingestion.

At their root, then, we have a basic picture of a toxin.

1. It is biological in origin.
2. It is poisonous.
3. There exists a delivery method by which it can harm another living creature.

## 1.2 How do toxins work?

What does it mean to be poisonous? When it comes down to it, toxins share much of their functionality. They generally do one of a couple of things: kill, damage, or weaken cells; or prevent or disrupt neural function in some way. But if that's all there is to a toxin, why do we need a document like this? Simply put, there's much more to the story than this, and those details are interesting. I assume if you're reading this, you think they're interesting, too.

## 1.3 On Dosage

You may have heard the phrase "the dose makes the poison", which is a simplification of Paracelsus's adage, "All things are poison and nothing is without poison; only the dose makes a thing not a poison." For many toxins, this is true; for many toxins it is not. Most are somewhere in-between, capable of causing lasting harm even at small doses, and even if the exposure to the toxin was brief or singular rather than over a long period of time. It is tempting to hammer out a proper toxicology model that accounts for these, but then again, it is quite complex. I suspect the effort would create a necessarily imperfect simulation, satsifying neither a user who needs a useful reference nor an expert who wanted a good model. Therefore I will commit my first oversimplification here, referring you instead to the toxicity scale that appears at the end of this Part.

## 1.4 Pharmacology

Toxins are a mixed bag. In the real world, we harness the toxicity of a number of substances for our own benefit. If you'll pardon the hyperbole, the entire field of pharmacology rests on this premise, that the introduction of a substance that is harmful in particular ways may prove beneficial in other ways. But the use of toxins as medicine is not without its risks: side-effects can be, and often are, quite harmful, and the costs of using them may ultimately outweigh the benefit. For our purposes, though, it is worth keeping in mind that when determining the toxicity, it is not always enough to say that a substance is toxic or that it is beneficial; it should be more nuanced, and I think we can capture that nuance here without introducing an unbearable amount of model complexity.

Just as in the real world, fantasy toxicologists of any skill should, through various means, be able to discover the range of harmful and helpful characteristics of any particular toxic substance. The toxicity scale provides a measure of the toxin's costs and benefits, and can be useful in weighing its value as a curative agent. In real world terms, the ability to separate and isolate effects to minimize harm and maximize benefit is primarily a matter of technology. In both real and fantasy worlds, however, knowledge of specific antidotes (themselves of similar biological origin) to specific toxins is often a matter of collected and local lore.

The term "antidote" will apply to toxins with pharmacological uses, even if there are significant risks in using them. The strength of the antidote will likewise be reflected on the toxicity scale.

## 1.5 Toxicity Scale

The toxicity scale comprises three parts. The left-hand side maps the toxin's beneficial aspects, from neutral to strong antidote. The right-hand side maps the toxin's harmful aspects, from neutral to fatal. The score sits in the middle. A definition of each of the terms used follows.

| Antidote Strength | Score | Toxin Strength |
|-------------------|-------|----------------|
| Neutral           | 0     | Neutral        |
| Weak Antidote     | 1     | Mild Toxin     |
| Moderate Antidote | 2     | Moderate Toxin |
| Strong Antidote   | 3     | Severe Toxin   |
| Superior Antidote | 4     | Fatal Toxin    |

Section 3.2 provides more details on the values in the Toxicity Scale.
