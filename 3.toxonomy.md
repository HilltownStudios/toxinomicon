# 3. Toxin Taxonomy (or, Toxonomy)

This section provides detailed definitions of the options that appear in a toxin listing (see [Part 2]) and the tables that comprise [Part 5]. It beging with the supertypes and works its way down to the actual harmful and/or beneficial effects of the toxin. It is the most technically dense of the Parts, but here you will find the information you need to understand a toxin listing or generate your own toxin.

## 3.1. Toxin Supertypes

In fantasy settings, toxins can have any combination of magical and mundane effects, though often these effects are exclusive or nearly exclusive to one or the other. These very broad categories are called supertypes. This section describes the supertypes and offers some notes on how to choose the supertype for the toxin you want to create for your setting.

### 3.1.1. Mundanotoxins

__Mundanotoxins__ exclusively or primarily act in mundane ways, causing a familiar array of bodily harm. The majority of mundanotoxins are neurotoxins, which means they affect the the brain and/or the central nervous system in some way, although there are subtypes that indicate a primary or exclusive effect localized to the nerve function of a particular part of the body, sometimes regardless of the delivery method in question.

### 3.1.2. Thaumatotoxins

__Thaumatotoxins__ exclusively or primarily act in magical ways, causing the kinds of damage that are more familiar to the fantasy adventurer than to those of a more mundane persuasion, though it should be noted that even here there is considerable overlap. Generally speaking, whereas mundanotoxins are stores of caustic and harmful chemicals, thaumatotoxins are stores of caustic and harmful magic.

Choosing the supertype should not be complicated. Simply consider whether you view the toxin in question as magical in nature or not. But in case you can't decide right away, or you want greater complexity, keep in mind also that it is perfectly acceptable to mix and match toxin effects from both magical and mundane lists to approximate something you've envisioned. 

## 3.2. Toxicity Scale

There are multiple competing scales for establishing the toxicity of a substance, and the complexity of toxin mechanics precludes easy real-world classification. For instance, just because a toxin is classed as a mild toxin does not mean it is almost harmless. Numerous personal circumstances can conspire to amplify the effect a toxin has on a victim, up to and including death or permanent impairment. Nevertheless, there *are* scales that estimate the overall level of harm. On the flip side, there is no scale I could find that estimates the level of benefit a toxin might possess (in which case it's called an antidote), so the following definitions are intuited from the existing toxicity scales.

### 3.2.1. Toxicity Strength

__Neutral__ toxicity means that the substance itself causes no harm. Substances believed to be antidotes in some sense, but are not toxic in any sense, fall under this category.

__Mild__ toxicity means that the substance is capable of dealing slight damage of a general or specific type, causes very minor impairment, and/or its duration is very short, usually in the range of hours or days. It is not likely to cause death or permanent impairment for otherwise healthy organisms.

__Moderate__ toxicity means that the substance is capable of dealing a concerning amount of damage of a general or specific type, causes moderate impairments, and/or has effects whose duration is longer, in the range of days or weeks, or may even be permanent. Weak organisms exposed to such toxins face a serious risk of death or permanent impairment. 

__Severe__ toxicity means that the substance is capable of dealing a catastrophic amount of damage of a general or specific type, causes severe impairments, and/or has effects that last days, weeks, or are permanent. Severe toxins can kill or permanently impair even healthy victims.

__Fatal__ toxicity means that the substance usually kills even those in the best health, and those who survive generally do so with significant permanent impairment. 

### 3.2.2. Antidote Strength

__Neutral__ antidotes provide no overt benefit. This is most often used in conjunction with something that is at least mildly toxic, since a wide array of toxins are simply harmful.

__Mild__ antidotes provide very modest benefits or do so for short durations, usually minutes or hours. Such befits can include curing a small amount of damage, temporarily alleviating a temporary or permanent impairment, confering a modest temporary enhancement to existing abilities, or temporarily confering new modest abilities.

__Good__ antidotes provide moderate benefits, often with longer durations, ranging from hours to days. Such benefits can include curing a moderate amount of damage, healing a temporary impairment, temporarily alleviating a permanent impairment, confering a moderate temporary enhancement to existing abilities, or temporarily confering new moderate abilities.

__Strong__ antidotes provide the most powerful benefits, often permanent. These can include curing large amounts of damage, healing an existing impairment, confering moderate long-term or permanent enhancements to existing abilities, or granting long-term or permanent new abilities. 

## 3.3. Toxin Delivery Method

Toxins enter the body by passing a particular skin or mucous membrane barrier. That's really it. Nevertheless, there is a good deal of biological variation in how the barriers are breached, which is where this section comes in. One thing to note is that a single toxin may have multiple delivery methods, or it may have only one. Those with multiple delivery methods may have localized effects that differ depending on where they are introduced. Such differential effects may be a result of the toxins' efforts to bypass the protective barriers of the vicitm and may not be the final effect.

### 3.3.1. Delivery Methods

__Ingestion__ is perhaps the most common delivery method for toxins. Numerous organisms have developed the means to attach themselves to comestible items in the hopes of ending up in the digestive tracts of their victims, despite the relative hostility of that environment. Intested toxins often cause localized distress, including upset stomach, vomiting, diarrhea, and ulcers. Others may find their way to specialized cells and tissue, including to the brain and nerves, to deliver their payloads. Mundane ingested toxins tend to have delayed effects that can be prevented or lessened through quick intervention, such as induced vomiting. Magical ingested toxins may also have delayed effects, but they are more likely to act quickly, releasing their stored magic.

__Inhalation__ of toxic substances introduces them into the victim's airways, causing localized distress of the lungs, bronchia, and the mucous membranes of the nose and mouth, include coughing, with or without colored or bloody discharge, wheezing, inability to catch one's breath, and fatigue. Mundane inhaled toxins act more quickly the stronger they are, and there are few interventions available. Magical inhaled toxins tend to act quickly across the board. Some toxins, magical and otherwise, are capable of building up in the system, with repeated exposure gradually ramping up the effects.

__Injection__ of toxic substances introduces them to the soft tissue and bloodstream via punctures in the skin and mucous membranes, often causing localized distress such as pain, itching, swelling, redness, infection, and necrosis. Both mundane and magical injected toxins tend to work quickly, since they have already bypassed the protective barriers of the victim's body. 

__Topical Absorption__ is when the substance bypasses the skin and/or mucous membranes by weakening or destroying the chemical structure of those barriers. This almost always causes rapid or immediate localized irritation of the affected area, including blistering, burning pain, swelling, and itching. In truth, both inhalation and injection are variations of the absorption method. 

### 3.3.2. Toxin Locality

Generally speaking, toxins can be classified according to the locality of their mechanisms, whether they affect all systems or target specific ones. The names of the toxin types in 3.4 below often imply the locality classification.

__Localized Stationary__ toxins affect only one area, the area of exposure. The scope of their effects may be limited only to the distress they cause in introduction, or they may cause localized secondary effects, such as loss of feeling or function, local nerve or tissue damage, and the like.

__Localized Mobile__ toxins move from their point of introduction through the body's various channels, and attach themselves to a particular kind of tissue or cell, often that of specific organs. The organ most commonly stressed by such toxins is the liver, whose role in filtering toxins makes it an obvious target. Effects depend on the organ or cells affected, but can include immune suppression, pain and discomfort, especially in joints, loss of motor function, and fatigue.

__Systemic__ toxins affect the entire body or major systems, such as the circulatory, central nervous, or digestive systems. Systemic toxins almost always travel, especially when there is no easy path between the point of introduction and the system in question, but also because the major systems span much of the body. Hemotoxins and many neurotoxins fall in this category, unless their effects are localized to particular sensory apparatus.

## 3.4. Toxin Types

### 3.4.1. Mundane Toxin Types

The list of mundane toxin types draws from the body of actual toxicology to the extent possible. In places, however, I found there were no adequate terms that described toxins that affected particular systems and organs, especially those that form the brain's main sensory apparatus. After reading through materials discussing the sensory system, I supplemented the three toxin types I could find with two names I think are plausible enough. Oculotoxins, olfactotoxins, and ototoxins already existed, but there were no terms covering the general sense of touch (for which I use haptotoxin) or the general sense of taste (for whih I use gustatotoxin). There is one other that belongs on this list, and that's a toxin that interferes with one's sense of spatial awareness, especially when it comes to one's own position in space. The sense is called proprioception, but I am unsure whether proprioceptotoxin is too much. It will remain provisional for the time being.

__Cardiotoxins__ weaken the heart through direct tissue damage (necrosis) or by interfering with the heart's electrophysiology. 

__Dermatoxins__ cause damage to the skin and mucous membranes. Weakening of these protective barriers makes the target more susceptible to other toxins introduced in the affected areas, including those that are not normally absorbed, since they have an easier time penetrating the barriers.

__Enterotoxins__ cause damage to the gastrointestinal system. Like dermatoxins, enterotoxins reduce the body's defenses against other toxins, especially ingested toxins.

__Genitotoxins__ cause damage to the urinary and reproductive organs. 

__Gustatotoxins__

__Hemotoxins__
