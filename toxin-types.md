### Toxin Supertypes

In fantasy settings, toxins can have any combination of magical and mundane effects, though often these effects are exclusive or nearly exclusive to one or the other. These very broad categories are called supertypes. This section describes the supertypes and offers some notes on how to choose the supertype for the toxin you want to create for your setting.

__Mundanotoxins__ exclusively or primarily act in mundane ways, causing a familiar array of bodily harm. The majority of mundanotoxins are neurotoxins, which means they affect the the brain and/or the central nervous system in some way, although there are subtypes that indicate a primary or exclusive effect localized to the nerve function of a particular part of the body. 

__Thaumatotoxins__ exclusively or primarily act in magical ways, causing the kinds of damage that are more familiar to the fantasy adventurer than to those of a more mundane persuasion, though it should be noted that even here there is considerable overlap. Generally speaking, whereas mundanotoxins are stores of caustic and harmful chemicals, thaumatotoxins are stores of caustic and harmful magic.

Choosing the supertype should not be complicated. Simply consider whether you view the toxin in question as magical in nature or not. But in case you can't decide right away, or you want greater complexity, keep in mind also that it is perfectly acceptable to mix and match toxin effects from both magical and mundane lists to approximate something you've envisioned.
